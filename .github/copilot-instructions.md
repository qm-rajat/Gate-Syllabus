# Copilot Instructions for Gate-Syllabus

## Project Overview
This is a single-page web application for visualizing the GATE exam syllabus as a weekly, interactive tree. The project is implemented entirely in `index.html` using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are no build steps, external dependencies, or frameworks.

## Architecture & Data Flow
- **Main File:** All logic, styles, and markup are in `index.html`.
- **Syllabus Data:** The syllabus is defined as a JavaScript array (`syllabusData`) in the `<script>` block. Each entry represents a week, with metadata for focus area, topics, and details.
- **UI Generation:** The tree structure is dynamically generated by JavaScript functions (`groupByFocusArea`, `createNode`, `buildTree`).
- **Interactivity:** Tree nodes expand/collapse using event listeners attached to dynamically created elements.

## Developer Workflows
- **Edit/Debug:** Directly modify `index.html` and open in a browser. No build or test commands are required.
- **Preview:** Open `index.html` in any modern browser to view changes.
- **No External Dependencies:** All code is self-contained; do not add package managers or build tools unless explicitly requested.

## Project-Specific Patterns
- **Data Structure:** Syllabus data is grouped by `focusArea` for tree display. Maintain this structure for consistency.
- **Styling:** CSS is embedded in the `<style>` block. Use BEM-like class names for new styles if needed.
- **Expand/Collapse Logic:** Use the `.open` class to control visibility of tree branches. Attach event listeners to `.node-content` spans for toggling.
- **Accessibility:** Favor semantic HTML and keyboard navigation if adding new features.

## Key File Reference
- `index.html`: Contains all code, data, and styles. Any changes should be made here unless the project is restructured.

## Example Patterns
- To add a new syllabus week, append an object to `syllabusData`.
- To add a new focus area, use a unique `focusArea` value in the data array.
- To change tree behavior, update the event listeners in `buildTree` and `createNode`.

## Conventions
- Keep all logic in `index.html` unless a migration to multi-file structure is requested.
- Do not introduce frameworks or libraries unless explicitly asked.
- Keep UI clean, modern, and responsive.
